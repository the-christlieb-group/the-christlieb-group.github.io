Upon completing his Ph.D., he took a postdoc in the Aerospace Department at the University of Michigan with Iain Boyd, working on the simulation of micro airfoils. He then transitioned to a postdoc in the Mathematics Department at the University of Michigan, where he worked with Robert Krasny on the development of mesh-free methods for plasma simulations. Since 2004, he has worked very closely with the RDHE group at the Air Force research labs on the development of new methods for particle simulations of plasmas. In 2006, Christlieb joined the mathematics department at Michigan State University. In 2006, he was awarded a Summer Faculty Fellow from the Air Force to work with AFRL Edwards on modeling of electric propulsion. In 2007, he received the Air Force Young Investigator Award for his work on the development of novel methods for simulating plasmas. From 2008-2012, Christlieb was an IPA for the directed energy group at Kirtland Air Force Base. In 2010, he was promoted to associate professor and in 2014 he was promoted to professor. In 2015, he was named an MSU Foundation Professor.</p> <p>Christlieb has an active research group, focusing on multi-scale modeling, high order numerical methods and sub-linear lossy compression algorithms. He is currently advising three postdocs and ten students. His former Ph.D. students have gone on to hold positions in national labs, industry and academia. He has been involved in the development of a host of high order Eulerian, Lagrangian and semi-Lagrangian conservative methods for the kinetic simulation of plasmas, as well as the development of high order finite difference constrained transport methods for the simulation of Magnetohydrodynamics targeted at AMR codes and new implicit Maxwell solvers targeting scale separation in plasmas. Christlieb's group is currently funded by AFOSR Computational Mathematics, AFOSR Physics and Electronics, AFRL RDHE, NSF Division of Mathematics and ORNL LDRD on scalable computing.</p>"},{"location":"people/","title":"People","text":""},{"location":"people/#2023-group-photo","title":"2023 Group Photo","text":""},{"location":"people/#2016-group-photo","title":"2016 Group Photo","text":""},{"location":"research/","title":"Research","text":""},{"location":"research/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":"<p>Moore's Law and an enormous multi-decade national investment in massively parallel computational resources have enabled numerical simulation to have a transformational impact on fields as diverse as aircraft development, bioinformatics and weather simulation. However, many problems of critical importance remain, in any meaningful sense, computationally intractable. A common theme throughout the hardest problems is the tight coupling of different underlying physical phenomena over a broad range of scales. To truly capture the promise of numerical simulation, there is an outstanding need to develop a new generation of scalable algorithms to efficiently simulate this type of complex, multiscale, problem.</p> <p>There are three categories of applications our group considers. The first is related to modeling complex multi physics problems in plasma science. The second area we work on is the development of methods that are aimed at solving interface problems in polymer membranes; think fuel cells, solar cells, and batteries. The third area we work on is the development of ultra-fast methods (sub-linear methods) for identification of sparse signals.</p> <p>The application-oriented work is facilitated by our focus on the development of high order methods (here high order can be thought of as high accuracy) for general classes of problems, that we then tweak for key applications. Our work on high order methods for hyperbolic conservation laws is a good example of this kind of work, where we developed general methods that we then extend to fluid models of plasmas.</p> <p>\u200bMore than half of our work centers on new method development, with the goal of making an impact on science through developing methods that enable us to explore problems that are beyond the scope of the previous generation of methods. The work is driven by advances in hardware, such as general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), the intel multi-core Phi technology and the heterogeneous computing platforms that have resulted from the synergy of these accelerators in new massively parallel computing platforms, such as the TITAN machine down at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. To be able to leverage these new computing platforms effectively, one needs to rethink our previous generation of algorithms in the context of these multi-core giants, where the number of floating-point operations is increasing at a rate far faster than the amount of memory one has in these computers.</p>"},{"location":"research/#plasma-science","title":"\u200bPlasma Science","text":"<p>So, what is a plasma?

This means that these methods are accurate and we can take as large a time step as we choose without the method going unstable. We have been able to develop these ideas for a range of general problems, including the variable speed wave equation for acoustics and the case of non-linear diffusion equations. Further, we have extended these ideas to applications such as Maxwell's Equations for electromagnetics, high order phase field models and the Vlasov Equation.

These membranes act as Maxwell's Demons, letting ions flow through the membrane while forcing electrons to flow through an external path to complete the circuit. Such membranes are used in solar cells, batteries and fuel cells. Further, the way in which these membranes function is deeply related to the behavior of lipid bilayers in cells of living tissue.  </p> <p>At its simplest level, one has a conducting polymer that is soft that can do work. By itself, this conducting polymer is not useful because it is too soft. To overcome this issue, a rigid polymer is introduced to the system that can form a scaffolding. The scaffolding provides the skeleton why the conducting polymer does the desired work. One way of assembling such a system is to cast a membrane.  When cast, one functionalizes the two polymers, that is a chain is added to one of the polymers that will make it hydrophobic and a different chain is added two the other polymer that makes if hydrophilic. This means that if the polymers were mixed, they would phase separate from one another. The polymers are mixed with a solvent that facilitates both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymer chains being intermingled. Then by drawing off the solvent, the polymers start to set and phase separate. Depending on many parameters in the system, including how the solvent is removed, one can change the morphology of the cast polymer.    </p> <p>Morphology of a membrane can be modeled accurately using detailed particle models, but these models can only simulate a few hundred picoseconds of the casting process. Typically, time associated with casting of these membranes is on may range from hours to days. Because of the lack of computationally tractable models that can be used to optimize the membrane casting in a virtual laboratory, the current approach to developing such membranes is Edisonian. This means it is an experimental process governed by trial and error. The introduction of a class of models that can simulate the cast structures of these membranes is of great use to this community.  </p> <p>This work centers on the idea that we can describe the evolution of polymer membranes with continuum models, known as phase field models. The most well-known phase field model is the Cahn-Hilliard Model for describing the evolution of grain boundaries in metals. Here we are working with a class of models known as the Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard Equations. \u200b </p> <p>Above are the results of a new phase field model designed to capture the structures that are possible in these complex systems. By slight modifications of the chemical potential in this model, the model can dramatically change the types of structure that is predicted. These three morphologies are common in cast membranes and having a tool that can predict what type of structure is possible is key. Once we have the structure, modeling the transport properties of the membrane is a well understood process and one can seek to optimize the casting process to give the best properties possible.    </p> <p>This work is in collaboration with Professor Keith Promislow's group. Our efforts here center on the numerical challenges introduced by these models. While it is possible to simulate long time scales with these continuum models, they are particularly challenging numerically, having up to 6th order derivatives and 4th order non-linear terms.   </p> <p>Our most recent work has been to extend the method of lines transpose ideas to the area of phase field models to generate an \\(O(N)\\) implicit method that is gradient stable for both scalar and vector phase field models.
